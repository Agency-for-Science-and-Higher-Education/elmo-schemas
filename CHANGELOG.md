Release notes
=============

This file describes all the important changes introduced to the schema after
its initial `1.0` release.

Please note, that all changes in the `v1` branch will be backward-compatible.


Version 1.0.0
-------------

Initial release of the schema.

There were some schemas in use before the `1.0.0` version, but this is the
first version which all the partners had agreed upon to be the common
**backward-compatible** component of all the future versions of the schema.
